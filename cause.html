        New York City being one of the major cities in America, is no exception 
        to havng many homeless people. According to
        <a href ="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/">
          coalition for the homeless
        </a>
        , there are now around 57,016 people who are homeless. NYC now has the highest 
        homeless levels since the 1930s. Many homeless peopel also suffer fro mental illness 
        and sleep on the streets or in the subway system.

        
        We believe that no person should go without a home and that trains and the streets are no 
        place for good living conditions. While shelters are not perfect, they are a better alternative 
        for people.

         

        This website is designed to help homeless people throughout the city find shelters 
        closest to them.
