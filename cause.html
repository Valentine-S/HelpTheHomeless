      <h1>About The Cause</h1>


      <p class = "cause">
        New York City being one of the major cities in the U.S.A, is no exception when it comes 
        to the growing homelessness epidemic throughout the country. According to
        <a href ="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/">
          Coalition for the Homeless
        </a>
        , there are now around 57,016 people who are homeless. NYC now has the highest 
        rates of homelessness since the 1930s. Many homeless people also suffer from mental illness 
        and sleep on the streets or in the subway system. We believe that no person should go without a 
        home and that trains and the streets are no place for good living conditions. While shelters are not perfect, 
        they are a better alternative for people.

        Additionally, many people given the current economic condiitons due to the COVID-19
        pandemic are at risk of or have been evicted even when accounting for the city's special eviction policies 
        implemented when the pandemic hit. If you are homeless or at risk of being homeless please go to <a href ="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/">
